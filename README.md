# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error
This example demonstrates a common error when working with Firebase's asynchronous nature. The code attempts to access data from a Firestore document snapshot before the asynchronous operation is complete, leading to undefined or null errors. The solution provides a proper way to handle this by ensuring data is available before access.
